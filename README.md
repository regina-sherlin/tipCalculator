# What is this project? 
  * This website is built for a fictional website as a design challenge from - [FrontEnd Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/sunnyside-agency-landing-page-7yVs3B6ef)
  * My task was to build the website as close to the design as possible. The designs were shared as figma assets and I had to translate it into a functioning website.
  * My first ever design challenge helped me understand the logic behind tip calculation in depth
  * This interactive application captures the bill amount and the number of people at the table and calculates the tip based on the percentage specified 
  
# What is it built with? 🏗️
  * It was built with HTML, CSS (pre-processors like SASS) and JavaScript
 
# What have I learnt in the process? 🤸
  * This interactive application captures the bill amount and the number of people at the table and calculates the tip based on the percentage specified 
  * I have looked for details and mostly eyeballed the design elements and replicated the design.
 
 # Things to add in the future ⌚
 - I need to do the same for mobile screens as well.
